# Customer-Details-Analysis

I just wrapped up working on a Power BI report that digs deep into customer details, The report comes in both Light and Dark themes, ensuring versatility. I can't wait to share it with you!

## Highlights:

1. Calculated the average age of our customers.
2. Unveiled the total count of our customer base.
3. Identified VIPs, Loyal Customers, and Periodic Buyers through smart categorization.
4. Explored revenue insights by considering if customers have children.
5. Implemented a dynamic ranking system to celebrate our top-performing customers.
6. Examined revenue trends by customer gender.
